# Jboss_Ansible
In this repo we have created ansible playbook which can compare and apply patches in jboss standalone server . We are using `jboss 7.4` for this testing . If there is domain mode setup of jboss then only `--host=$host_name` only need to add in the provided Patch command .To run this code one needs to download a `jboss 7.4` zip folder and a `jboss 7.4 patch zip` file . At first the `jboss 7.4` need to up and running in standalone mode then after downloading the patch file one can easily apply the path with the `yml` code . One just need to adjust the paths in order to run this process properly .

Thanks ,
